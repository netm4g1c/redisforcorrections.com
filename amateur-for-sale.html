					<summary><em>Custom 12V 100Ah LiFePO4 Battery Box - $300</em></summary>
					<p>Custom 12V 100Ah LiFePO4 Battery Box. A LiTime 100Ah LiFePO4 battery in a NOCO box with custom power distribution installed. Ready to power your next multi-radio operation, long hour operation, repeater, or station backup battery.
					Can also be connected to an inverter for camping or other activities.
					Weighing in at under 30 lbs, this is a large capacity battery that is actually portable! Connect your equipment to the built-in connectors, or directly to the studs. Has two 50A circuits with one Anderson SB50 connector and
					one PP45 connector on each circuit. Also has a 15A accessory circuit with a cigarette socket, dual USB A for charging, and a USB C/USB A QC3.0 module. Also has an integrated voltmeter. All circuits are protected by resettable circuit breakers.

					<summary><em>HP 8567A Spectrum Analyzer (10kHz - 1.5GHz) - $50</em></summary>
					<p>HP 8567A Spectrum Analyzer (10kHz - 1.5GHz). One of the link cables is broken and needs a new 50-pin Centronics connector soldered on. After that, unit should be fully functional.
					Calibration is stored in volatile memory and unit is missing calibration battery but there is no damage on the board from a leaky battery. Therefore, unit is uncalibrated. We did a quick
					and dirty test and the unit seemed fairly accurate, perhaps several Hz out of alignment in the 144MHz band. Warning: This is a 4U rackmount system split into two units. It is large and heavy.
					Has TXCO.
